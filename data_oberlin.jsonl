Scientists from the University of Vermont, Tufts University, and the Wyss Institute at Harvard unveiled a groundbreaking development in self-replicating living robots!\n\n\ud83d\udd2c These \"Xenobots\" (originally created in 2020 from frog cells) assemble \"baby\" xenobots inside their Pac-Man-shaped \"mouths,\" which grow into new robots, able to replicate themselves over and over.\n\n\ud83e\uddea This discovery reveals an entirely new form of biological reproduction, sparking excitement in the fields of regenerative medicine and AI. The Xenobots, designed by AI, are reshaping our understanding of life's replicative capabilities.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding and controlling self-replicating systems. They believe that technologies like Xenobots could accelerate the development of solutions, from cleaning up pollution to creating new medicines.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Let's stay curious and open-minded as we continue to unravel the mysteries of life and technology. The future is full of promise and possibilities! Read more in the link in bio :)\n\nImage cr.
